# Iterative-Prototype-2

 For the next iteration of my game, I want to actually design the world/level. I also want to alleviate more stress of the racing mode
 by adding a basic test track with no timers, no obstacles, etc. Essentially, a place to test the car.
 This would help players feel more confident in their driving and they would get to opt into the racing portion of the game when they feel ready.
