# Iterative-Prototype-1

For the iterative game design process, I will be using my third prototype, my racing game.
It's available here: https://github.com/AxelHenir/Prototype-3-Fixed-Upload

# From the previous playtest...

In the exploration prototype, I learned much of what people inherently understand and what people want when faced with a racing-style game.
I learned what my game lacked on a fundamental level and I hope to implement these features firstly:

- A training area so the player can try the car out
- A dedicated race area that player can choose to start
- Controller Support

I also want to eventually implement these other features:

- Leaderboards with best race times
- Switch cars with a menu
- Minimap and/or road signage
- Engine sounds


# Design Hypothesis

In this iteration of the prototype, I want to try and decide on the focus or specialty of the game. 
I'm leaning towards making this game as a series of challenges where players can improve their times.
I want the game to feel relaxing and easy to play but still provide a sense of skill-expressive maneuvering.

Hypothesis:

Will the player feel comfortable with the driving mechanics if they get the chance to try them in freeplay?
Does this take the stress of racing off of the player and make them more interested in trying races again?
Check for improvement: Does the car feel easy to use?

# Playtesting Results

Due to being sick the previous week, I did not attend the in-person playtesting but I still managed to receive playtetsing feedback from my friends and family. 

In the playtesting session, my testers were all happy too see the return of the Akina downhill (level name) but felt that the new car mechanics made the car hard to maneuver in the "arcade"-esque level. This was the most prominent focus since the previous iteration. 

I managed to make some changes to the UI and logistics of the game (ability to restart, teleport to race start, saving best times, etc.) Which players were very happy to use. I noticed that in this iteration of the playtest, people felt that driving safer was better because crashing now meant you lost all your speed. This helped better resolve the game's identity as more realistic as far as physics behave.

In terms of how this change in car maneuvering affected how the player felt, (recalling my intention is to make a "game [that feels] relaxing and easy to play but still provides a sense of skill-expressive maneuvering.") Most players still felt stressed... I asked them where their stress was coming from and received varying answers:

-The timer counting 
-The complexity of the course
-The fact that it's a race 
-Crashing 

All very valid concerns! For the next iteration of my game, I want to actually design the world/level that this game lives in. I also want to
alleviate the stress of the race by adding a basic test track with no timers, no obstacles, etc. Essentially, a place to test the car.
This would help players feel more confident in their driving and they would get to opt into the racing portion of the game when they feel ready. 

Crashing will always be a part of the game >:)
