 # From the Previous Playtesting Session:
 
 I gauged my tester's reactions to a new car controller system which was more realistic and improved the navigation of the game. Testers were content for the most part  to see these additions. Some testers made comments about the visual style and scale of the game feeling off so in the next portion of the iterative updates, I want to include a new world and track to race on- one that's better suited to the game. 

# Design Hypothesis

 For the next iteration of my game, I want to actually design the world and level. I also want to alleviate more stress of the racing mode
 by adding a basic test track with no timers, no obstacles, etc. Essentially, a place to test the car.
 This would help players feel more confident in their driving and they would get to opt into the racing portion of the game when they feel ready. 

Design Hypothesis Question: Will players prefer the ability to self-improve in a freeplay-esque environment or will they gravitate towards and actively seek out completion of the game? Can a game's aesthetic direction and composition alleviate the stress of intense gameplay?

I'm hoping to pick and develop a visual style for the game as I build the map. I want to be able to prototype quickly so I'm going to be using assets I find on the unity asset store.
