 # From the Previous Playtesting Session:
 
 I gauged my tester's reactions to a new car controller system which was more realistic and improved the navigation of the game. Testers were content for the most part  to see these additions. Some testers made comments about the visual style and scale of the game feeling off so in the next portion of the iterative updates, I want to include a new world and track to race on- one that's better suited to the game. 

# Design Hypothesis

 For the next iteration of my game, I want to actually design the world and level. I also want to alleviate more stress of the racing mode
 by adding a basic test track with no timers, no obstacles, etc. Essentially, a place to test the car.
 This would help players feel more confident in their driving and they would get to opt into the racing portion of the game when they feel ready. 

Design Hypothesis Question: Will players prefer the ability to self-improve in a freeplay-esque environment or will they gravitate towards and actively seek out completion of the game? Can a game's aesthetic direction and composition alleviate the stress of intense gameplay?

I'm hoping to pick and develop a visual style for the game as I build the map. I want to be able to prototype quickly so I'm going to be using assets I find on the unity asset store.

# Playtesting Notes

In this week's playtesting session, I realized the errors in my world building. The setting isn't important to the player when presented with the car and the ability to drive. Testers appreciated the resetting functionality because they had to make constant use of it. The players would consistently get stuck on the ridges left by the road generation. Testers indicated that the car needs improvements to its driving  controls. I agree, it wasn't sliding the way I would want it. The players said that they would like a test track but that when they were dropped into the game, they didn't know what was what. I should label the different events/places in the game. I also want to scale the game a bit better, trees were the wrong size and the terrain is bland.

Going forward, I want to divide the game into levels where the goal of each is clear. If a player opens a menu and clicks on the training level, they'll know that they're in training mode. Likewise for races. I want to adjust the power of the car to be less "jerky" and a bit more controllable. At the same time, I can add a controls scheme and if time permits, add controller support.
